# SNN-Implementation
Research Internship at IITD involving Spiking Neural Networks.

Spiking Neural Networks involve modelling neurons which are biologically more realistic than the traditional artificial neuron, which makes them extremely energy efficient. However, due to the non differentiability of the delta function (used to model spikes), gradient based learning methods pose a challenge.

We can opt for techniques such as the Surrogate Gradient Descent, or ANN-SNN conversion.
